## First time setup

1. Install needed dependencies.  If one does not want to use brew, read through the Brewfile and install the documented tools.

```bash
brew bundle install
```

2. Allow direnv

Direnv will need your approval to load in the environment.

```bash
direnv allow
```

This will also install the pre-commit hooks and load in environment variables.
